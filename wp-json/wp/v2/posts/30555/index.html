On the other hand, quality control (QC) involves using software testing and inspection to identify existing defects and ensure that the software adheres to specified standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality is the foundation of the development process. Delivering software of low quality to end users can result in various issues, such as failing to meet customer expectations and negatively impacting the brand&#8217;s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although these process-oriented activities may vary, they collaborate to improve software quality. They also enable development teams and project managers to implement efficient strategies for managing quality throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog post, we will highlight the similarities and difference between quality assurance and quality control.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-qa-vs-qc-a-brief-introduction\"><strong>QA VS QC: A Brief Introduction\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality control is the process of identifying and rectifying defects in fully completed products to adhere to the project&#8217;s required quality standards. These activities are reactive and help in detecting deviations from pre-established criteria or issues. The main objective of Quality control is to ensure that the software is as defect-free and usable as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the main objective of quality assurance activities is to maintain quality consistently throughout the development process. This includes preventing defects from arising early in the development life cycle and prioritizing quality maintenance throughout the entire development phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through regular audits, process evaluations, and adherence to development best practices, the QA process makes sure that the final product meets quality standards without any corrective measures after the completion of development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-features-of-quality-control-qc\"><strong>Features of Quality Control (QC):<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality control primarily emphasizes that each product meets established standards and specific requirements at a product-specific level. It is applied after the active development phase as a reactive process, distinguishing it from Quality Assurance (QA).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain high levels of quality post-development, this testing-centric methodology includes various testing types, including performance, usability, and functionality tests. These tests allow QC professionals to identify inconsistencies, defects, and instances of non-compliance with quality standards, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the product before it reaches consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tools-and-techniques-in-quality-control\"><strong>Tools and Techniques in Quality Control<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>QC professionals use various tools and techniques to assess a product&#8217;s quality. Popular tools like Bugzilla and JIRA facilitate issue tracking and reporting, streamlining testing efforts by allowing testers to document, assign, and resolve issues efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing includes manual testing, which involves human input and is often detailed, and automated testing, which prioritizes speed and consistency through scripted tests. Regression testing, typically automated, ensures that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Various QC testing methodologies, such as Six Sigma, Lean Production, and Total Quality Management, offer options for testers to employ in their processes. Often, QC testers combine these tools, techniques, and methodologies for comprehensive testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-quality-control\"><strong>Benefits of Quality Control<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary objective of QC is to ensure software meets requirements, regulations, and quality standards before release which benefits both businesses and consumers. It enhances brand reputation, fostering trust and loyalty among customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-key-features-of-quality-assurance-qa\"><strong>Key Features of Quality Assurance (QA)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality assurance (QA) prioritizes proactive measures to prevent defects from affecting the final product, rather than solely reacting to issues after development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A successful QA includes several essential practices, including comprehensive planning, defining, and refining processes to address potential defects early in the development cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, QA involves conducting regular training sessions for team members, meticulously documenting processes, and continually striving for process improvement. By ingraining quality into every aspect of the development process, QA ensures consistent delivery of high-quality products, fosters consumer trust, and minimizes the occurrence of post-development defects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tools-and-techniques-in-quality-assurance-qa\"><strong>Tools and Techniques in Quality Assurance (QA)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance the QA process&#8217;s efficiency, QA professionals use a wide range of tools and techniques to maintain software excellence, quality, and reliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing a successful QA strategy is about using various techniques. Standards definition establishes clear quality criteria, while process design increases operational efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-quality-assurance-qa\"><strong>Benefits of Quality Assurance (QA)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality assurance (QA) is important in software development as it ensures that software adheres to rigorous standards. It reduces the necessity for expensive post-development corrections while also optimizing the overall development cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By its proactive approach, QA allows development teams to identify issues early in the process. This results in businesses reducing their time to market and achieving cost savings through more effective resource allocation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-control-and-assurance-limitations-nbsp\"><strong>Quality Control and Assurance<\/strong><strong> Limitations&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing QA standards and processes requires a significant investment in terms of resources, time, and training. Some perceive QA as overly focused on processes, hindering creativity and slowing down the development cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>QA&#8217;s purpose is to prevent defects, it does not minimize the need for Quality Control (QC). QC is crucial for identifying and rectifying defects that may have been missed during QA processes. Using both QA and QC processes together is essential to ensure that the final product meets all required standards and reduces defects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite various benefits, QC has limitations. Its biggest constraint is the inability to guarantee 100% defect-free software. Some defects may remain undetected even after rigorous testing and inspection processes because of various factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, QC can be time-consuming and costly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quality-control-vs-quality-assurance-a-comparative-analysis-nbsp\"><strong>Quality Control vs Quality Assurance<\/strong><strong>: A Comparative Analysis&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While QA and QC are different processes, they have a common objective, which is to help businesses deliver high-quality software that complies with industry standards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The objective of QA is to prevent defects early in the development process through systematic processes and standards. On the other hand, QC follows a reactive approach, identifying defects post-development through thorough inspection and testing. While each process has its merits when used independently, their combined use fosters a more resilient, quality-focused culture within organizations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding and integrating Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) is important for organizations looking to deliver top-notch products or services. QA prioritizes defect prevention through systematic processes, while QC centers on identifying and rectifying defects in final outputs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Hashlogics, we understand the importance of Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) in delivering top-notch products or services.

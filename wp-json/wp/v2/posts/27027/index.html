The objective of SDLC is to provide superior software that not only meets but exceeds customer expectations, all while being completed on time and within budget.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-explain-sdlc-and-its-importance\"><strong>Explain SDLC<\/strong><strong> and its Importance?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Managing software development can be challenging because of evolving requirements, technology advancements, and cross-functional collaboration. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology offers a structured management framework with well-defined deliverables at each stage of the software development process. Consequently, stakeholders can align on development objectives and requirements upfront and have a roadmap to achieve them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some benefits of full lifecycle software development are listed below:<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It provides a standardized framework outlining activities and deliverables.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helps in project planning, estimation, and scheduling.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It simplifies project tracking and control.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It increases visibility across all software delivery lifecycle aspects for stakeholders involved in the development process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It speeds up the development process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It improves client relations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It reduces the project risks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It decreases production costs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understanding-the-dynamics-of-software-development-life-cycle-models-and-approaches\"><strong>Understanding the Dynamics of Software Development Life Cycle: Models and Approaches<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of building a software application is guided by The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which outlines various tasks. Developers progress through several stages, integrating new features, and fixing bugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following this, we&#8217;ll explore the different parts of the full Software Development Life Cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analyze Customer Needs:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, the first step is about understanding what your customers need. This phase is about collecting information from different sources and planning the process accordingly. It begins by determining what customers want, accessing the required resources needed, and finally planning the cost to ensure a successful and affordable development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. <\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>Outline a Plan:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We plan the resources, costs, and other small details of the project before moving forward with the structure. Resources are something we can handle, but what requires close planning is the cost limit. The development teams need to ensure that everything is balanced properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Create a Design:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the design phase, you have to create a design to define the overall framework based on your project requirements and the detailed plan. The design stage encompasses various aspects, including the project&#8217;s name, description, functionality, and the identification of key elements and technical gaps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, there are two levels of design &#8211; Low-level design (LLD) and High-level design (HLD).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.<\/strong>&nbsp; <strong>Coding Phase:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This phase is among the most extensive stages in the software development life cycle. Developers take the lead here, doing what they are best at. They write the software code and implement it by following pre-defined code quality and coding standards, using the necessary programming tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.<\/strong> <strong>Test the Progress:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the coding is done, the next step is to test the system&#8217;s functionality. This stage aims to verify if the entire software is operating as expected. Additionally, it aims to identify and address any bugs or technical glitches that may be present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.<\/strong> <strong>Deployment:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the significant moment everyone looks forward to. If developers find no issues in the testing phase, they proceed to launch the software product. It is crucial to emphasize that ensuring a smooth deployment process, free of errors, is equally important based on the feedback received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.<\/strong> <strong>Ongoing Maintenance:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the deployment stage in software development life cycle models, it is important to begin observing various aspects once customers start using the product. It includes timely updates, prompt bug fixing, and the addition of the latest features. This phase is equally important as the initial one to maintain the efficiency and functionality of the software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"840\" height=\"301\" src=\"https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Software-Development-Life-Cycle-SDLC.png\" alt=\"image for Software Development Life Cycle\" class=\"wp-image-30244\" style=\"width:839px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Software-Development-Life-Cycle-SDLC.png 840w, https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Software-Development-Life-Cycle-SDLC-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/Software-Development-Life-Cycle-SDLC-768x275.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-phases-of-software-development-life-cycle-models\"><strong>Phases of Software Development Life Cycle Models<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SDLC methodologies refer to the approaches and techniques used by software development teams to navigate through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The most common SDLC examples or models are listed below:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-waterfall-model\"><strong>Waterfall Model<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The waterfall model is one of the oldest and simplest examples of the software development life cycle, which includes five phases: requirements analysis, specification, design, implementation, unit testing or functional testing, integration, operation, and maintenance. This model guarantees the consistent use of minimal resources and the project&#8217;s unchanging behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(It would be best to present the below points in the form of a table or an image)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project Size \u2013 Small, Concise<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 Average<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required Resources \u2013 Moderate<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of Project \u2013 One time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-agile-model\"><strong>Agile Model<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/what-is-agile-methodology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">agile methodology<\/a> or agile model organizes the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into several development cycles. The team iterates through these phases quickly, providing small, incremental changes to the software in each cycle. They consistently evaluate requirements, plans, and outcomes, allowing them to respond swiftly to changes. The agile model is both iteration and increment, making it a more effective approach compared to other process models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project Size \u2013 Large<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required resources \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of Project \u2013 Continuous<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-spiral-model\"><strong>Spiral Model<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spiral Model in SDLC processes can be the best option when project requirements are unclear and frequent changes are expected. If your project requires assistance in both development and improvement, choosing this method is recommended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a prototype-based model with an iterative feature for developing new versions of the software. The risk-driven aspect of the spiral model allows customers to use a prototype, specification, or simulation-oriented approach for their project. This model also provides the flexibility to create highly customized products to meet the specific needs of customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project Size \u2013 Big<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required Resources \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of Project \u2013 Continuous<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nbsp-scrum\"><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Scrum<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For projects with massive architecture that demand continuous adaptation to market dynamics and evolving customer needs, the Agile-Scrum methodology stands out as an ideal process within the software development life cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scrum is an agile framework that assists in managing software development and design. It is used by small or medium-sized teams typically consisting of three to nine members. These teams work on larger projects and divide their tasks into time-boxed iterations known as sprints. The duration of a sprint can vary, lasting from one week to one month, depending on the specific requirements of the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project size \u2013 Large Scale<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required Resources \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of Project \u2013 Continuous<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nbsp-v-shaped\"><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>V-Shaped<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the V-shaped model, verification and validation phases run side by side.

It is important to note that &#8220;features&#8221; in the context of the software development life cycle don&#8217;t mean typical software functionalities. Instead, they are quite similar to Scrum user stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project Size \u2013 Big<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 Moderate<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required Resources \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of Project \u2013 Continuous<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joint Application Development:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a joint application development approach, experienced industry professionals work with IT experts from a Centre of Excellence (CoE). They work together to carefully plan the project from its early stages. Using the specifications and requirements collected during the planning, they shape the final software product. After the planning phase, customers can also be involved in the design stage to understand the actual expansion and execution of the project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Project Size \u2013 Medium or Big<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required resources \u2013 High<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Type of project \u2013 One-time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rapid Application Development<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;ve got a unique idea that requires complete confidentiality and aims to reach the market as an initiator to take advantage as a first-mover, Rapid application development is perfect for such projects.

By the end of this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of IT outsourcing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-it-outsourcing-nbsp\"><strong>What is IT Outsourcing?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IT outsourcing service is an effective way to deliver IT solutions to businesses worldwide.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IT services include various services, such as web design to set up an entire IT infrastructure. Now, many companies partner with IT outsourcing companies to cut labor costs, improve business performance, and access highly skilled professionals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three main types of IT outsourcing:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Onshore<\/strong>: It means hiring professionals that are located in your city or nearby.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offshore<\/strong>: To outsource to nearby countries with the same time zone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nearshore<\/strong>: To outsource to a different country.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As per <a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/resources\/small-business-outsourcing-primed-to-boom-in-2023\">Clutch<\/a>, 83% of small businesses plan to either maintain or increase their spending on outsourced business services in 2023. They emphasize that the primary reasons for IT outsourcing are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>To save money&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bring industry knowledge to the in-house team.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For entrepreneurs, especially startup founders, IT outsourcing can be a key to accelerating their business growth and saving money compared to having a small in-house team. Even big companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook choose to outsource certain tasks, as it provides access to professionals with diverse expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-three-popular-it-outsourcing-models-nbsp\"><strong>Three Popular IT Outsourcing Models&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you sign a contract with an IT outsourcing company, it is important to select a cooperation model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s explore the three common types of IT outsourcing models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-project-based-model\"><strong>Project-Based Model:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client hires a team to do the work that is already planned out. The project manager from the outsourced team takes full responsibility for the project&#8217;s quality and performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model is best for uncomplicated projects with predictable and thoroughly researched features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dedicated-team-model\"><strong>Dedicated Team Model:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The team hires a team to create a project for them and the team only focuses on that project. Unlike the project-based approach, a dedicated IT outsourcing team is completely engaged in your project. In this model, the outsourced team acts as both your technical and product advisor, providing ideas and suggesting alternative solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dedicated team IT outsourcing model is best for startups in their early stages of growth, complex long-term projects, and projects with unclear requirements. If you&#8217;re looking to validate your idea, find a product-market fit, or develop an MVP to test the market, choosing a dedicated team is the ideal option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-outstaff-model\"><strong>Outstaff Model:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You hire a full-fledged development team and hire separate specialists. Sometimes, the project might need some additional professionals, and you can hire outstaff workers to handle that part of the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model is best for short-term projects or businesses that require additional assistance to quickly expand, especially if they lack certain expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hashlogics is an outstaffing and <\/strong><strong>IT outsourcing services company<\/strong> that offers various services like product outsourcing and staff augmentation. Here are two scenarios where working with us can bring you significant benefits:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you don&#8217;t have enough in-house resources within your company and need more help to develop a product, consider IT outstaffing.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you lack product expertise and need a team of product managers, designers, developers, and QAs to build your product, then IT outsourcing is the way to go.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to learn about \u201chow to outsource software development?\u201d Check out our blog post<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-you-should-use-it-outsourcing\"><strong>Why You Should Use IT Outsourcing?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you understand IT outsourcing, its models, and its types. It is important to understand why you might need to outsource and whether it is necessary. Let&#8217;s discuss the <strong>top 3 reasons why to choose IT outsourcing<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-nbsp-nbsp-you-are-an-industry-expert-with-an-idea\"><strong>1.<\/strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>You are an Industry Expert with an Idea:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an expert with a great idea that solves a genuine problem, IT outsourcing is the way to go. Your main goal is to quickly enter the market and test your solution. An outsourced team can help you validate the idea, create an MVP to test your hypothesis, and implement changes in your product based on market demands. It saves you both money and time, helping you achieve your goals efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-nbsp-nbsp-you-are-a-young-startup\"><strong>2.<\/strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>You are a Young Startup:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Early-stage startups often face the challenge of spending money quickly before having a solid team and a ready-to-market product. According to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.failory.com\/blog\/startup-failure-rate\"> Failory<\/a>, financial difficulties are the third most common reason for startup failures. Therefore, it is a good step to reduce costs by hiring an outsourced team of professionals while your business relies on investor&#8217;s money. You can employ a full-cycle product development studio to address all blind spots and bring your product to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-nbsp-nbsp-you-need-technical-assistance\"><strong>3.<\/strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>You Need Technical Assistance:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your existing solution requires technical improvements such as a backend framework, updates, new language, enterprise application integrations, or UX\/UI design, it is best to find an experienced partner.

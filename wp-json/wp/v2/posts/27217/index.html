Bubble is a powerful no-code development platform that allows you to build and create web applications without writing code.<br>Bubble is an exciting technology that revolutionizes the way we interact with data. To read more about Bubble, check out our article on \u201cWhat is Bubble.io? A Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post highlights a range of apps you can build with Bubble, including niche marketplaces, industry-specific job boards, and efficient booking systems. Let\u2019s explore each of them in detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-marketplaces-nbsp\"><strong>Marketplaces&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketplace apps make it easier for buyers and sellers to connect, making transactions more convenient and efficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no-code platforms like Bubble, you can easily create smaller, specialized versions of a marketplace. It includes all the essential features necessary for a successful marketplace, such as integration with payment gateways, setting up user profiles, enabling reviews, and advanced search functions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-marketplace-app-built-with-bubble-nbsp\"><strong>A Marketplace app Built with Bubble:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TicketRev<\/strong>: An event ticket marketplace that allows fans to submit bids for event tickets at their desired price and seating location, providing sellers the option to accept the bid and sell their tickets right away.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"641\" height=\"301\" src=\"https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/A-Marketplace-app-Built-with-Bubble.png\" alt=\"A Marketplace app Built with Bubble\" class=\"wp-image-30159\" style=\"width:840px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/A-Marketplace-app-Built-with-Bubble.png 641w, https:\/\/hashlogics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/A-Marketplace-app-Built-with-Bubble-300x141.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-bubble-is-the-ideal-choice-for-building-marketplaces\"><strong>Why Bubble is the Ideal Choice for Building Marketplaces?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bubble provides flexibility for customizing your marketplace, both in functionality and appearance. With the variety of plugins and useful integrations available, you can effortlessly enhance your marketplace&#8217;s capabilities. For example, integrating payment gateways such as Stripe Connect ensures safe transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketplaces mainly focus on desktop users, aligning with Bubble&#8217;s capabilities. All element&#8217;s properties are optimized for desktop functionality, improving the user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bubble provides numerous templates for marketplaces, eliminating the need to begin your project from scratch. You can use a pre-tested design as your foundation, enhancing efficiency in the development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-troubleshooting-best-practices-nbsp\"><strong>Troubleshooting Best Practices&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-handling-complex-transactions\"><strong>Handling Complex Transactions<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> Managing transactions in a marketplace can be complex as there are different parties involved, like sellers, buyers, app owners, and payment processors. It&#8217;s crucial to distribute funds accurately among them, considering various charges. Make sure you understand both Bubble and your chosen payment processor. Particularly focus on developer logs as they provide detailed transaction responses and show important details like the identities of the seller and buyer, the transaction amount, the recipient, and whether the transaction was successful. It will give you confidence in processing payments correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-user-roles-and-functions\"><strong>User Roles and Functions:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong> <\/strong>In most marketplaces, different users have specific roles, such as sellers or buyers. To handle this, assign unique roles to users in your database using an option set. Use user conditionals in your workflows to determine what actions or features are accessible based on the user&#8217;s role. For effective testing, use clear email addresses that identify the user&#8217;s role. For instance, adding \u201cseller\u201d or \u201cbuyer\u201d to the email address helps in identifying roles during testing. Like user+seller@mail.com, user+buyer@mail.com, etc. This method minimizes confusion and ensures that the right functionalities are assigned to the respective user roles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-job-boards-nbsp\"><strong>Job Boards&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Job boards are online platforms that allow companies to post job openings and job seekers to submit their applications for specific job positions. Some well-known job boards are Indeed and LinkedIn. No-code development is ideal for building smaller versions, like niche or company-specific job boards.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Niche job boards focus on specific job categories or industries, making them ideal for job seekers looking for opportunities in a particular field. While, companies looking to showcase their unique culture, values, and job opportunities can create their own company-specific job board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-job-boards-built-with-bubble-io-example\"><strong>Job Boards built with <\/strong><strong>Bubble.io Example<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Workello<\/strong>: A skill-testing platform designed to help companies quickly and efficiently identify and hire the top 1% of their writer applicants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ten<\/strong>: A niche job board that connects event producers with proficient technicians in the event production industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-bubble-excels-in-building-job-boards\"><strong>Why Bubble Excels in Building Job Boards?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With Bubble, you can easily create job boards that reflect your brand&#8217;s identity.

You can set up automated notifications for different events, such as new job postings or job matches. Users can receive these notifications through email, SMS, or their preferred communication channels. This feature helps job seekers stay updated on relevant opportunities, increasing successful connections between candidates and employers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-troubleshooting-best-practices-nbsp-0\"><strong>Troubleshooting Best Practices&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid repeating the same search, create a \u201chidden variable\u201d within a popup, that can keep track of all the results of the specific data type. It facilitates updating or modifying the search logic, which can be executed in a centralized manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-booking-and-appointment-apps\"><strong>Booking and Appointment Apps<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The application is versatile, catering to various services from medical practices and beauty salons to personal trainers and consultants. Using this app, users can pick their preferred service provider, select a desired date and time for their appointment, finalize the booking, and securely pay through the app&#8217;s payment gateway. A booking confirmation is sent to the users containing all the information. Meanwhile, professionals can manage their availability, receive bookings, and coordinate with their clients through the app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bubble.io allows you to customize your system to meet the specific demands of various industries.

Additionally, you can integrate waitlists for fully booked events or dates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-troubleshooting-best-practices\"><strong>Troubleshooting Best Practices<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When dealing with calendars in Bubble, you might notice that the default appearance isn&#8217;t very customizable or flexible. If you want to customize it, you&#8217;ll need to use a bit of coding. You can check out the Bubble community forum or ask ChatGPT for help in tweaking the code so you can personalize your calendar and make it just the way you want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-budgeting-and-finance-app-nbsp\"><strong>Budgeting and Finance App&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Budgeting and personal finance apps play an important role in helping individuals make informed decisions about their money.

For instance, if your monthly income is consistently the sum of four elements, rather than repeatedly calculating this sum, designate a specific group to store the computed value for quick reference. It is beneficial for breaking down complex equations into simpler parts. By assigning meaningful names within dedicated groups, you can improve code readability and keep things organized. This practice not only simplifies troubleshooting but also facilitates the maintenance of your app&#8217;s calculations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-educational-apps-nbsp\"><strong>Educational Apps&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>E-learning platforms have revolutionized how we share and learn knowledge.

AI allows digital devices to interpret their surroundings, analyze data, and execute purposeful actions to achieve objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyday applications of AI include web search engines, recommendation systems like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify, speech recognition technology used by virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, and Alexa, as well as self-driving car technology developed by companies like Tesla.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we will explore and address the common question: what is the future of AI? As artificial intelligence continues to advance, its impact on society grows more pronounced. We will highlight some benefits and challenges posed by AI&#8217;s evolution, and examine its role in various industries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-ever-changing-landscape-of-ai\"><strong>The Ever-Changing Landscape of AI<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its beginnings in 1951, AI has undergone remarkable progress. Christopher Strachey created the first successful AI program, a checkers game on the Ferranti Mark I computer at the University of Manchester.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, advancements in machine learning and deep learning have led to significant milestones. Notably, IBM&#8217;s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, followed by IBM Watson&#8217;s victory on Jeopardy in 2011.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generative AI, introduced by OpenAI with its GPT models in 2018, has exemplified the latest phase of AI development. This has led to the creation of advanced models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, enabling AI to generate various forms of content in response to queries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI has also made significant contributions to various fields, including sequencing RNA for vaccine development and modeling human speech. These advancements rely on machine learning models and algorithms, emphasizing perception, reasoning, and generalization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-will-ai-affect-the-future\"><strong>How Will AI Affect the Future?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how will AI change the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-improved-business-automation\"><strong>Improved Business Automation:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/quantumblack\/our-insights\/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year\">About 55 percent of organizations<\/a> have started using AI to different extents, showing that more and more businesses are automating tasks. With chatbots and digital assistants, enterprises can handle customer interactions and address basic employee inquiries with AI assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, AI can easily analyze large amounts of data and present insights in user-friendly visual formats can speed up the decision-making process. By using instant insights generated by AI, company executives can make well-informed decisions without the need for extensive data analysis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-job-disruption\"><strong>Job Disruption:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Business automation has raised concerns regarding potential job losses. Research shows that employees believe that AI can handle nearly one-third of their tasks. However, the impact of AI adoption varies across industries and professions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain manual roles, such as secretarial positions, are at risk of automation, while demand for specialized roles like machine learning specialists and information security analysts has increased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-climate-change-concerns\"><strong>Climate Change Concerns:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is expected to have a significant impact on sustainability, climate change, and environmental issues. Some see AI as a tool to increase supply chain efficiency, implement predictive maintenance, and reduce carbon emissions. However, there are concerns that the energy and resources needed to develop and sustain AI models could substantially increase carbon emissions by up to 80%, undermining sustainability efforts in the tech industry. Even if AI is used in climate-conscious technologies, the costs associated with building and training models may cause environmental challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-in-industries\"><strong>The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Industries<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI has influenced nearly every major industry.

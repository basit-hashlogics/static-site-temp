Later on, it offers solutions to mitigate these risks. Security testing can either be done manually or by automating ways.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Penetration Testing<\/strong>: It simulates a malicious hacker&#8217;s attack on a system. It involves analyzing a specific system to identify potential vulnerabilities that a hacker might exploit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Risk Assessment<\/strong>: It analyzes security risks within an organization. It categorizes them as low, medium, and high. It suggests controls and measures to reduce the risk.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ethical Hacking<\/strong>: The purpose of ethical hacking is to identify security weaknesses within the organization&#8217;s system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Application Security Testing<\/strong>: security application testing is a type of testing that concentrates on identifying vulnerabilities within the application. This involves examining the application&#8217;s code, configuration, and dependencies to find any potential vulnerabilities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Posture Assessment<\/strong>: It combines security scanning, ethical hacking, and risk assessments to give an overall evaluation of a system&#8217;s security.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-software-security-testing-tools\"><strong>Software Security Testing Tools\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Software security testing tools are easily accessible in today&#8217;s market.

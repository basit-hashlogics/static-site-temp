Delivery partners pick up the orders from the restaurants and deliver them directly to customers&#8217; doorsteps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Here the image will be added \u2013 for reference: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fatbit.com\/fab\/how-to-build-an-app-like-ubereats\/\">https:\/\/www.fatbit.com\/fab\/how-to-build-an-app-like-ubereats\/<\/a> &#8211; or I will send the image idea)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cashing-in-on-cuisine-decoding-uber-eats-revenue-model\"><strong>Cashing In on Cuisine: Decoding Uber Eats&#8217; Revenue Model<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, Uber Eats generated a revenue of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/uber-eats-statistics\/\">$10.9 billion<\/a>.

The total fee may vary depending on the market in which the company operates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission From Restaurant Partners:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber Eats cuts a commission ranging from 15% to 40% of the total order value from its restaurant partners. However, the exact percentage can vary based on the market&#8217;s age and maturity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Marketing and Advertising Fee from Restaurants:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber Eats provides restaurants with the opportunity to attract more customers by promoting their listings within the app. Restaurants can pay additional fees to feature their menus prominently or to run special promotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Premium Subscriptions:<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber Eats provides premium subscriptions like Uber One and Eats Pass for customers looking for special perks like free delivery, exclusive menu access, and priority delivery.
